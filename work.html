          <p><strong>ControlWorks telephony</strong> &ndash; Capita SSS</p>
          <p>Aside from trying to wrap my head around some of the most awesomely deep and complex software I've ever seen, I've been taking a deep-dive into combined radio and telephony interfaces so I can make a start on improving some of the most fundamental interactions and features within CW - dealing with 'calls' for help, however they might come in to the control room.</p>

          <p><strong>The Hairforce products</strong> &ndash; The Hairforce</p>
          <p>With the overall structure for the Hairforce sites in place I've been taking a closer look at The Hairforce's brand new product range. Although I can't say any more about the products themselves I've had great fun advising on the product branding and designing and liasing with a high-end London design agency on incorporating their design 'beats' into the site.</p>
          <p>I've also been kept busy building a design system using Sketch (and Sketch Cloud) for The Hairforce brand assets and working out the best way to show this off.</p>
