          <p><strong>ControlWorks comms</strong> &ndash; Capita SSS</p>
          <p>My first major project at Capita is a close look at one of the most fundamental interactions in the ControlWorks application - receiving and processing incoming emergency contacts from the public. This has necessitated a deep-dive into radio and telephony APIs and their related UIs (or lack of them). I should be busy for a while yet.</p>

          <p><strong>External home page</strong> &ndash; University of Bath</p>
          <p>The external home page (<a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk">www.bath.ac.uk</a>) hadn't seen a redesign in almost 10 years. It was starting to resemble an untouchable relic of some bygone era of the web.</p>
          <p>Over a 6 month period, starting in late 2018, I headed up a small team of designers, devs and content creators tasked with making this long-neglected page relevant again.</p>

          <p><strong>The Hairforce products</strong> &ndash; The Hairforce</p>
          <p>I've been taking a closer look at The Hairforce's brand new range of products. A large part of my work has been liasing with a  London design agency and working out how to extend their brand design concepts into a fully-fledged online presence.</p>
          <p>I've also been kept busy building the Hairforce design system in Sketch (and Sketch Cloud).</p>
