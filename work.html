          <p><strong>ControlWorks telephony</strong> &ndash; Capita SSS</p>
          <p>Aside from trying to wrap my head around some of the most awesomely deep and complex software I've ever seen, I've been taking a deep-dive into combined radio and telephony interfaces so I can make a start on improving some of the most fundamental interactions and features within CW - dealing with 'calls' for help, however they might come in to the control room.</p>

          <p><strong>The Hairforce products</strong> &ndash; The Hairforce</p>
          <p>With the overall structure for the Hairforce sites in place I've been taking a closer look at The Hairforce's brand new product range. Although I can't say any more about the products themselves I've had great fun advising on the product branding and designing and liasing with a high-end London design agency on incorporating their design 'beats' into the site.</p>
          <p>I've also been kept busy building a design system using Sketch (and Sketch Cloud) for The Hairforce brand assets and working out the best way to show this off.</p>

      <!-- Current employment -->
      <h2>Current role</h2>
      <p>In April 2019 I started work as a Senior User Experience designer at <strong>Capita Secure Software Solutions</strong>.</p>
      <p>I'm currently working on the UX and UI for a whole range of complex features for Capita SSS's flagship software, ControlWorks. ControlWorks is software for emergency services control rooms.</p>
      <h3>Freelance and personal projects</h3>
      <p>I try to keep my hand in with a number of personal and freelance projects running concurrently with my day job.</p>
      <p>I offer UI, UX and IA consultancy and support for long-standing Karyx and Nsource clients.</p>
      <!-- Recent History -->
      <h2>And before that&hellip;</h2>
      <p>Between 2014 and early 2019 I was a <a href="work-uob.html">User Experience designer at the University of Bath</a>.</p>
      <p>I was part of the small agile team responsible for all aspects of design and front-end development across the main university website.</p>

      <!-- Ancient History -->
      <h2>And way back in the day&hellip;</h2>
      <p>I was making interactive CD-Roms for the BBC and Carlsberg-Tetley at MousePower in 1996, designing animated e-learning for BP at Nsource in 2000, and creating user-focused, content-driven websites for third sector organisations like the <a href="https://www.ethicaltrade.org">Ethical Trade Initiative</a> and <a href="https://www.refugee-action.org.uk/">Refugee Action</a> at Karyx until 2013.</p>
