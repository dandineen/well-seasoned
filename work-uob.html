            <!-- No.1 - Bespoke publishing platform -->
            <h3>Designed and built a bespoke publishing platform</h3>
            <p>The University had outgrown its current content management system and 'off-the-shelf' options just weren't up to the job.</p>
            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Planning, designing and building a bespoke CMS (‘Are you mad?’)</li>
                <li>Defining and structuring a completely new publishing journey</li>
                <li>Gaining staff and stakeholder buy-in</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Solutions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Staff and stakeholder interviews/workshops to establish core needs and requirements</li>
                <li>Iterative design process seeking feedback from users at each stage</li>
                <li>Feature-led development cycle</li>
            </ul>
            <a id="second"></a>
            <h4>Outcomes</h4>
            <p>More than three quarters of the content on <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk">bath.ac.uk</a> is now created and managed through our Content Publisher application. Feedback from content creators, faculty web editors and marketing staff has been extremely positive.</p>
            <!-- No.2 - Flexible front-end templates for content types -->
            <h3>Designed and built flexible front-end templates for multiple content types</h3>
            <p>The first step in our digital transition was to design and develop a series of flexible content type templates.</p>
            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>No standard content structure - everything is bespoke!</li>
                <li>No formalised digital design language</li>
                <li>Organisational issues around change management</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Solutions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Ran user workshops with content creators, editors and stakeholders to establish needs and requirements</li>
                <li>Developed content models and user journeys</li>
                <li>Created a simple content-led design system, Origins, inspired by <a href="http://gov.uk">gov.uk</a></li>
                <li>Worked closely with the build team to develop robust, accessible, flexible templates in HTML, CSS and JS</li>
            </ul>
            <a id="third"></a>
            <h4>Outcomes</h4>
            <p>We developed a clean, simple, content-driven design language, flexible enough to work across a myriad of content types.</p>
            <!-- No.3 - Origins, the original design language -->
            <h3>Developed Origins, our beta design language</h3>
            <p>Origins, our beta design system, was based on the content-led approach taken by gov.uk. It showcased a distinct move towards placing the page content front and centre, whilst paring back the design to leave just the essentials.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first re-design of bath.ac.uk for almost 10 years</li>
                <li>Stakeholder expectations</li>
                <li>branding management</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Solutions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A simplified, stripped back design system focused on clarity and readability</li>
                <li>Designed to be modular from the ground up</li>
                <li>Retained a degree of ‘classic’ University of Bath branding while introducing more modern elements</li>
            </ul>
            <a id="fourth"></a>
            <h4>Outcomes</h4>
            <p>We developed a clean, simple, content-driven design language, flexible enough to work across a myriad of content types.</p>
            <!-- No.4 - Student admissions journey -->
            <h3>Redesigned the application journey</h3>
            <p>One of the most important journeys on the University site, student admissions had not been re-worked for more than 7 years. We needed to start from scratch to meet the changing requirements of both internal and external users.</p>
            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Incredibly complex information hierarchy</li>
                <li>Competing user needs (internal and external)</li>
                <li>No unified approach to course structure around the University</li>
                <li>Differing faculty/departmental requirements</li>
                <li>A new look required</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Solutions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Gathered user needs and requirements through stakeholder and end user interviews</li>
                <li>Worked closely with dev and content teams to construct a robust course content model</li>
                <li>Used guerrilla research to talk directly to the ‘difficult to reach’ 18-21 demographic</li>
                <li>Designed an entirely new visual language for the course pages</li>
            </ul>
            <a id="fifth"></a>
            <h4>Outcomes</h4>
            <p>The completely redesigned application process, especially the course and subject pages, are significantly more elegant.</p>
            <!-- No.5 - Lens design system -->
            <h3>Developed Lens, our new design system</h3>
            <p>During the course page redevelopment, it became clear that we were moving away from Origins in terms of look and feel.</p>
            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating a modern, flexible design system that can power 20 different content types, all with wildly varying content requirements</li>
                <li>Establish a component-based workflow across all disciplines. We don’t design and build whole pages any more!</li>
                <li>Move the University brand forwards without contradicting what we already have in print etc.</li>
                <li>Establish a long-term design system that pulls together a style guide, a pattern library and other content creation</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Solutions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Audit our existing design system Origins, along with other design assets across the University</li>
                <li>Hold stakeholder and end user interviews to establish expectations, needs and requirements</li>
                <li>Developed a new design language</li>
                <li>Applied this new componentised design system to a number of content types</li>
                <li>Created the Lens design system, pattern library and style guide. It’s not automated yet but it’s getting there!</li>
                <li>Defined a new component-based workflow that integrates the pattern library into our process</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Outcomes</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The pattern library provides a quick and easy way to build static prototypes, reducing development time at this stage.</li>
                <li>Lens has been embraced across the University with previously recalcitrant faculties and departments embracing transition more positively as the new templates better meet their requirements</li>
                <li>Positive response from users in target 16 - 18 demographic. The new look, structure and approach is more in line with their expectations of a modern, dynamic organisation</li>
            </ul>
