          <p><strong>External home page</strong> &ndash; University of Bath</p>
          <p>Untouched for almost 10 years, and apparently containing one of the oldest active bits of Javascript on the entire internet, the UoB external home page is a political hot-potato. With so many stakeholders involved the home page has always been torn between differing priorities and requirements. The update had been on the roadmap for years but every previous concept or prototype had fallen at the first hurdle - no-one could agree on the content. Statistically we could tell that the home page is fallen in importance to potential students as they were entering the site directly at departmental or course level.</p>
          <p>Over the last few months of 2018, and in to 2019, I worked to produce a number of new concepts testing out prototypes built in <a href="#">Principle</a> and <a href="#">Adobe Xd</a>. Working quickly, I started getting these prototypes in front of as many people as we could. We iterated based on the feedback and, ever so slowly, a home page started to take shape.</p>

          <p><strong>Staff/Students landing pages</strong> &ndash; University of Bath</p>
          <p>Two vital, but oft-overlooked, internal landing pages finally get some love and attention. We start with a series of interviews with key users, an online card sort to clarify terminology and cut down on jargon, usability sessions and a multivariate test through <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/optimize/">Google Optimize</a> to round things off.</p>

          <p><strong>Research degrees in Typecase for Courses</strong> &ndash; University of Bath</p>
          <p>Research degrees, sometimes known as doctoral programmes, are a further level of research-led study available at the university. I've been working closely with the Doctoral College to understand the differences in structure, terminology and approach between research degrees and their undergraduate cousins.</p>

          <p><strong>Improving mobile navigation</strong> - University of Bath</p>
          <p><em>This is now live! Take a look at <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/courses" title="University of Bath courses">https://www.bath.ac.uk/courses</a></em></p>
          <p>The current implementation, a tiered, fixed navigation is <em>so</em> big it obscures almost all page content on smaller devices. This is obviously far from ideal. I’m testing out some quick nav prototypes built with <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/studio">InVision Studio</a> to get an idea of what might work.</p>
